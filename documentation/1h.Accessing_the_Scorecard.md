### Scorecard tutorial

1. **Running the testing tool:** From the main menu of LLM Canary, select option 5 to start the scorecard

![Main Menu](./../documentation/screenshots/main_menu_v0.png)

Everytime a test is run, the result is stored in `scorecard/results` under `[LLM_ID]_[DATETIME_OF_RUN].yaml`. These reports will be pulled directly into the scorecard. 

When you enter the scorecard, you will be taken to the homepage. The homepage contains resources includinglinks to the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, links to useful tools for creating and testing prompts, and links to the LLM-Canary website. 

The left naviagation pane will display every test that has been run. Tests are identified by `[LLM_ID]_[DATETIME_OF_RUN]`

After selecting the desired test run, you will be taken to the scorecard. At teh top it will display which LLM was run, it's unique identifier, and the datetime that the test was run.

The scorecard test page can be broken up into three parts:

1) **The Benchmark** - This is a comparison of all Test Group scores to the Benchmark. Only benchmark Test Groups can be compared to the benchmark.
2) **The Test Breakdown** - This shows the ID of all tests run, whether they passed or failed, their weighting, and the final score on both a Test Case and Test Group Level.

3) **The Test Details** - This section shows the full conversation with the LLM and the expected responses so that users can review the tests and gain a better understanding of why a test passed or failed.
