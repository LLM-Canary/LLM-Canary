# LLM Canary

Welcome to LLM Canary!

The LLM Canary tool is an easy-to-use open-source security **benchmarking test suite**. This tool empowers developers to test, evaluate, and benchmark LLMs. Developers can distinguish between security trade offs when selecting a model, and are positioned to resolve LLM vulnerabilities before integration. Test groups are based on OWASP Top 10 for LLMs and the tool is designed to be kept up-to-date with the most current and relevant threats.

With the LLM Canary tool, you can:
 - **Identify potential vulnerabilities** based on the OWASP top 10 for LLMs
 - **Define risk** for identified vulnerabilities
 - **Run multiple LLMs at once** to improve speed and effectiveness of tests
 - **Compare your results** to our [benchmark](./documentation/benchmark_methodology.md) or to past runs
 - **Create custom tests** to customize your testing experience and ensure thoroughness of testing.

To get started, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](./documentation/quick_start.md).
